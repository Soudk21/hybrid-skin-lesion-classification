## 📄 Abstract

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of our **ICSPIS 2025** submission for binary melanoma detection on the **HAM10000** dataset. We address key challenges in dermoscopy-based skin cancer diagnosis: class imbalance, limited data, and the need for lightweight, interpretable models.

Our **hybrid framework** fuses **33 handcrafted dermatological descriptors** (shape, color, texture) with **6 supervised LDA-reduced deep features** extracted from a lightly fine-tuned **ResNet-50**. Using classical ML classifiers such as **LightGBM**, we achieve a **ROC-AUC of 0.958** and **accuracy of 0.944**, outperforming individual feature sets while remaining computationally efficient for clinical deployment on consumer-grade hardware.
