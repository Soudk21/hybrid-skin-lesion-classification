## Abstract

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of our **ICSPIS 2025** submission for binary melanoma detection on the **HAM10000** dataset. We address key challenges in dermoscopy-based skin cancer diagnosis: class imbalance, limited data, and the need for lightweight, interpretable models.

Our **hybrid framework** fuses **33 handcrafted dermatological descriptors** (shape, color, texture) with **6 supervised LDA-reduced deep features** extracted from a lightly fine-tuned **ResNet-50**. Using classical ML classifiers such as **LightGBM**, we achieve a **ROC-AUC of 0.958** and **accuracy of 0.944**, outperforming individual feature sets while remaining computationally efficient for clinical deployment on consumer-grade hardware.

## Features
- Preprocessing: Lesion masking, augmentation (rotations, flips, shifts), standardization.
- Handcrafted Features: Asymmetry, border irregularity, GLCM, LBP, RGB statistics.
- Deep Features: ResNet-50 fine-tuned (5 epochs, LR=1e-5), penultimate activations reduced via LDA to 6 components.
- Fusion: 33 + 6 = 39-D vector.
- Classifiers: SVM, KNN, RF, XGBoost, LightGBM (with grid search CV).
- Evaluation: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision/recall/F1 on stratified splits.

---

## Results
- Best Model: LightGBM on 39-D fusion → ROC-AUC: 0.958, Accuracy: 0.944
- See `/results/` for plots and tables.

| Experiment | Feature Set | Best Classifier | Accuracy | ROC-AUC |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| E1        | 33 handcrafted | LGBM/XGB       | 0.907   | 0.883  |
| E2        | 33 + PCA      | LGBM/XGB       | 0.915   | 0.917  |
| E3        | LDA(6) only   | RF/LGBM        | 0.907   | 0.902  |
